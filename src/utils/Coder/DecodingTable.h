/* DecodingTable.h
 * Copyright (C) 2014, Francisco Claude & Rodrigo Canovas & Miguel A. Martinez-Prieto

 *
 * This class implements a compact table for decoding prefix-based codes. It 
 * comprises two main structures:
 *
 * 1) The decoding table (of 2^k entries) implemented as a sequence of log(x)
 *    bits per entry.
 * 2) A byte-stream (of size x bytes) listing all different decoding 
 *    possibilities in the compressed text.
 *
 * This decoding structure is used as follows. The compressed text is read in
 * chunks of k bits and these are used as keys for accessing the table. That 
 * is, the k-bit chunk is transformed into a number in the range [0, 2^k-1] and
 * its corresponding entry in the table references the decoding information in 
 * the stream. It is worth noting that not all k-bit possible chunks are really
 * used in the text. In these cases, the corresponding entries store the value 0.
 *
 * The stream concatenates all decodeable substrings according to the following
 * features:
 *
 * 1) The first byte encodes the control information. It is divided in two 
 *    halves:
 *    - The first 4 bits encodes the number of characters: 'c' decoded in the
 *	current step.
 *    - The second half represents the number of bits minus 1: 'b', consumed in
 *	the current decodification step. Thus, the last 'k-b' bits in the 
 *	current chunk will be the first ones in the next chunk..
 *
 * 2) The c next bytes represent the decoded characters in the substring.
 *
 *
 * It is worth noting the exception arising when the k-bit chunk does not 
 * represent a full codeword (this means that the length of this codeword is
 * greater than k bits), so the decoding must be implemented over the code 
 * tree. In these cases, 'c=0' and 'b' tells the number of bytes used for 
 * representing the pointer to the corresponding node in the code tree. These
 * pointer is encoded (using VByte) in the following c bytes.
 *
 * This structure must be used with values of k <= 16.
